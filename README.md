## Getting Started

### Pre-requirements
- Download Qt and install your preferred compiler
- Add the path to your Qt's bin/ folder to the environment variable PATH
  - If you already have the same compiler installed, make sure the path to Qt's
    bin folder is ahead of your existing compiler's.

### Building the Application
- run `qmake` in the root folder of the application
- run `make` (might be named differently depending on your compiler)

Your executable application should now be created in `Release` folder!
